This repo holds my custom firmware for my [Keyboard.io](https://blog.keyboard.io). Details on how the firmware works and how to customize it can be found [in their upstream repo](https://github.com/keyboardio/Model01-Firmware).

To build the firmware, run `make`. To flash, run `./scripts/flash.sh`.
